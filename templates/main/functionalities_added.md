# Functionalities added/changed

## 1. Integrated Ollama as an AI Provider

Ollama, which is a **local AI provider**, has been integrated alongside **OpenAI** and **Gemini**.  
Since it does **not require an API key**, users can simply select **Ollama** and their preferred model in **Settings**.  
Once selected, it is saved in the configuration, and you can start chatting with **Buddy AI** immediately.  
Buddy AI will respond to prompts just like with other providers.

If the user tries to start chatting with **Buddy AI** without configuring any **AI provider** or any **model** in settings
